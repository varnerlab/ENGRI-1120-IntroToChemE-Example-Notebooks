    "### Introduction\n",
    "In a Flash separation process, a multicomponent saturated liquid composed of the species set $\\mathcal{M}$ enters the Flash drum (at some temperature and pressure). Inside the drum the pressure is rapidly decreased leading to [flash vaporization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_evaporation), and a liquid and vapor streams exit the drum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total and Species mole balance Flash drum\n",
    "There are no chemical reactions occuring in the Flash drum, thus, the number of moles is conserved. The total mole balance around the Flash drum is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{F} = \\dot{L} + \\dot{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{F}$ denotes the total mole flow into the unit (units: mol/time), $\\dot{L}$ denotes the total mole flow rate of the liquid stream exiting the unit (units: mol/time), and $\\dot{V}$ represents the total mole flow rate of the vapor stream leaving the unit (units: mol/time). \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can write a species mole balance around all the species in the species set $\\mathcal{M}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{F}z_{i} = \\dot{L}x_{i} + \\dot{V}y_{i}\\qquad\\forall{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z_{i}$ denotes the mole fraction of component $i$ in the input stream (we use $z$ to avoid confusion with the liquid stream exiting the unit), $x_{i}$ denotes the mole fraction of component $i$ in the liquid stream exiting the unit, and $y_{i}$ represents the mole fraction of component $i$ leaving the unit in the vapor stream.

    "### Problem\n",
    "The teaching team suggests that a liquid feed stream that contains 64% Cyclohexane(1) and 36% Water(2) can be separated in a Flash Drum operating at P = 67.0 kPa and T = 75$^{\\circ}$C. The saturation pressures of pure components A and B can be modeled using the [Antoine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_equation): \n",

    "\\ln\\left(P_{i}^{sat}\\right) = A_{i} -\\frac{B_{i}}{T+C_{i}}\\qquad{i=1,2}$$\n",

    "where $T$ denotes the temperature in units $^{\\circ}$C and $P_{i}^{sat}$ denotes the saturation pressure in units of kPa for component $i$, and $A_{i},B_{i}$ and $C_{i}$ denote the Antoine parameters for compound $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Assumptions__:\n",
    "1. The flash drum is well-mixed\n",
    "1. The contents of the drum are in vapor-liquid equilibrium, and hence, the vapor and liquid streams that exit the drum are in vapor-liquid equilibrium\n",
    "1. Equilibrium is instantaneous inside the drum\n",
    "1. All phases everywhere are ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    " * The fraction of the input stream that exits the drum as liquid\n",
    " * The fraction of the input stream that exits the drum as vapor\n",
    " * The composition of the liquid ($x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$) and vapor ($y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$) in the exit streams"
